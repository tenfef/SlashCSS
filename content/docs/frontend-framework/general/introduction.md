##### Introduction

ZapCSS is an object oriented CSS framework built using scalable design patterns and modern CSS architecture. In order to ensure consistent and accurate project design implementation the principals introduced in this framework are designed to be simple, semantic and quickly understood by both designers and developers.

> You donâ€™t need to choose one methodology; combine the concepts of a few methodologies into one that works for you and your team. <cite>&#8212; Patrick Catanzariti, sitepoint</cite>

ZapCSS is built and maintained with a combination of Sass, PostCSS and CSS custom properties. It combines the best features of most the popular existing methodologies and provides front-end developers with a neatly packaged lightweight system to kick start any web project.
